When you want to look for a particular uploaded file on your WordPress site, don’t you know how to find it?

FileBird was born to help you overcome the obstacle. This plugin gives you the ability to easily organize your files in media library of your site. With this tool in hand, you can manage and arrange thousands of images, audios, videos, and other files in your media library.
